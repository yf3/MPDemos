# Assignment 1: Halftone Dithering

## Ideas
+ Make use of opencv libraries to perform image processing.
+ MVC architecture to separate the image processing part and GUI part of the program.
+ By applying the strategy design pattern and setting the hierarchy of the strategy classes, the program is pretty desirable in scalability -- new dithering or color-to-grayscale algorithms can be added easily.

## Test Results

> Figure.1 to Figure.3 shows the result of normal grayscale-to-binary ordered dithering with Bayer matrices (threshold maps)

> Figure.5 to Figure.7 compare the previous results with the results using the algorithm described by Figure.4 to make output image remain uniform size.

## Known Issues

+ The result of Floyd-Steinberg dithering shown here actually use a weird standard to distinguish black and white color: by using value 240 as a separator instead of 128. But the result is surprisingly great.
+ Image showed in javafx "ImageView" class sometimes looks different from the real result. To see the accurate result, use the export button to see the image file.
+ Very large pictures sometimes cannot be loaded properly.

## Something I learn from the assignment

+ Setting up the opencv developing environment for Java language and Java IDEs.
+ Understand multiple color-to-grayscale and dithering algorithms and how to implement them.
+ Getting more familiar with basic git commands.
